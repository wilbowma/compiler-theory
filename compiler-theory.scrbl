@title{CPSC 539B -- Compiler Theory}

Compilers are responsible for writing almost all of the programs that get
executed. Like all programs, compilers have bugs. But unlike most programs, when
compilers have bugs, they can insert bugs into other peoples’ code and give
programmers little recourse.

All compilers have bugs, and this course will teach you what a compiler bug is,
how to reason about compilers so you better understand where the bugs are and
how to prevent bugs if you ever write a compiler. This course will introduce
some techniques of formal reasoning about programs, programming languages, and
compilers. The course will then review recent compiler correctness research, and
study the different ways a compiler can be correct, or incorrect, and how to
implement a correct compiler and prove that it’s correct.

My goals with this course are:

@itemlist[
@item{Introduce students to reasoning about programs and program transformations.}
@item{Introduce students to space of compiler correctness.}
@item{Convince students to think about compilers in terms of judgments preserved.}
