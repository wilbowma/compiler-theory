# compiler theory
This repository contains lecture notes and other material for my "compiler
theory" course.
It contains a lot of mistakes, typos, simplifications, and generalizations.
These are necessary evils due to the nature of the course, and because the
course is still quite new and unpolished.

You should not use this material unless you really know what you're doing.
